### What I learned

In this exersise I wanted to test my css knowledge while doing a 100-days of code challenge. I learned that all websites are already responsive. I also learned how to emplement light/dark mode with ease using Sass variables.

### Continued development

I would like to learn how to plus my own social media information into this project(not sure if this is possible but will be researching it)

### Useful resources

- [Conquering responsive layouts](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/conquering-responsive-layouts) - This helped me really get a grasp with responsive layouts. If anyone out there wants to upgrade their css knowledge I HIGHLY recommended this course.
